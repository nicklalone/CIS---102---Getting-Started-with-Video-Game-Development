# Welcome! 

This course is meant to help you get started in video game development using a limited console that has everything we need to work by ourselves until we're ready to work with others. Remember that video game development (and all of programming) is a collaborative effort. Getting started here means getting started as the member of a new community. It'll be awkward for a while but soon, after some growth, you'll start to contribute to that community. 

This course is organized for you to follow in one of two ways. 
1. Only reading the lecture notes. 
1. Following along with the lecture notes with my videos. 

The videoes can be found on Youtube at: TBD

I will leave this up here for you to work on by yourselves but this course will also be offered at [Bellevue University](http://www.bellevue.edu/) as a general education course. 

[You can find the syllabus here.](course%20documents/syllabus) in word and in markdown. I'll also be creating a list of readings that could help inspire you and give you some history about what PICO-8 is for.

## So where will we be working?

For the sake of all of our sanity, we will be using the [PICO-8 Fantasy Console](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) as I find that it helps bridge the gap between playing games and making games in useful, interesting ways.

## **Some useful links:** Will add and organize to these as I find them.

By the time we are finished, you should have enough knowledge to go out and make something interesting.
